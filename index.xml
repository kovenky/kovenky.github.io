      <description>Introduction Linear regression is a basic machine learning algorithm used for supervised learning tasks involving prediction and forecasting. It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and one or more independent variables (features/predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
Sample Input The input to a linear regression model consists of:
A dataset with one or more independent variables (X) and a continuous target variable (y) The data is split into training and test sets The training data is used to train the model i.</description>
