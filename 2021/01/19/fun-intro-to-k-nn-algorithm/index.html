<p>A girl from an orthodox family loved a boy while in college.</p>
<p>She informed her parents about this relation and expressed interest that she would like to marry him.</p>
<p>She shared all the details about the boy to her parents that she knew.</p>
<p>After some usual family drama, parents agreed to the wedding but with one condition that only if the boy passes background check.</p>
<p>Now, her parents would like to find more about the boy and take decision of go or no-go.</p>
<p>The parents arrived at boy’s place, and started inquiring about the boy with nearby residents.
They were able to speak with 3-families which are very close to boy’s house.</p>
<h3 id="here-are-the-responses-look-like">Here are the responses look like</h3>
<hr>
<p>Left-Side Resident: Endorsed the boy and wished good luck [positive]</p>
<p>Right-Side Resident: They didn’t endorse [negative]</p>
<p>Other Resident: Shared all good things about the boy [positive]</p>
<p>Out of these three evidences, only 1-negative feedback which results to a final positive overall as the majority of votes are positive.</p>
<p>The parents are now peacefully agreed, and the girl is happy :-)</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s K-NN algorithm applied by parents.
Here, k=3, three nearest neighbors and
We have 2-classes (Go/No-Go) — binary classification
Feedback=Vote: Weight =1</p>
<p>Hope the above story was fun to read and intuitive example of K-Nearest Neighbors!</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, let us learn more about how K-NN works.</p>
<p>The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.</p>

<p>Find k-nearest points (uses the euclidean distance) of a point on which you want to make a prediction
Voting or Average of Multiple Neighbors
For regression (numerical value) problems — average (i.e. mean) is used.</p>
<p>For classification (categorical value) problems — we take majority of voting, that is mode, value that is observed frequently in a set.</p>
